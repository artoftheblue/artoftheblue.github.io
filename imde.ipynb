    "# IMDE, Homework-2, Placement Optimization in Circuit Design\n",

    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Placement optimization is an important phase in designing circuits. Two main aspects to optimize in this problem are maximizing space utilization and wirelength minimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this problem is far outside the domain of this homework due to its sheer complexity. Typically, auto-placement algorithms are used to solve this problem, such as PCB design or CAD software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the problem's complexity, such programs utilize linear optimization only partially, to eliminate solutions which are definitely non-optimal. The placement problem otherwise is solved via many trial-and-error iterations, as well as greedy algorithms & simulated annealing methods. This problem is largely connected to graph theory, in which increasing the number nodes hastily leads to a further increase in complexity in order to unambiguously determine exact, optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking all this into account, a much simplified version of this problem will be considered. Effectively reducing the problem to component placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "It would have been great to consider data from a real chip to optimize, but solving such a problem for real-world values using a reduced linear programming algorithm would not yield any meaningful results since we have to use too many variables to get anything proper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I introduce random values that I have hand-picked in order to not make the optimization problem too trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try to introduce as comprehensive of a list of parameters and restrictions as possible, while keeping everything relatively simple. Let's reduce the problem to minimizing the distance between circuit components, without any additional optimizations (like wires, their density, buffers between components, temperature regulations, location of connection, etc.) because that would exponentiate the difficulty greatly. We'll have enough with many different constraints we'll have to consider anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i \\in C} (x_i + y_i) \\to \\min$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem considered in this homework was definitely solved. However, the problem at question is, unfortunately, quite a rudimentary version of what can actually be used when solving real-life problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using plain linear programming is insufficient to solve these kinda problems in reasonable time, and increasing the number of components or bins leads to an exponential rise in complexity and time required to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it was reasonably fun to try and consider all the endless constraints required to solve even a crude version of a circuit optimization problem. It successfully positioned these components on a grid (which is a reduced version of a circuit board, after all), packing all the components very close to each other and not leaving any gaps. I would consider this a massive success.\n",
